These are files used in lecture for Math 241 (Calc IV) taught by myself (Paige Randall North) during Spring 2021 at the University of Pennsylvania. They are Jupyter notebooks which use Python and Numpy.

### [02-16.ipynb](02-16.ipynb)

Used in 16 February's lecture. There is code to graph the sum of the first 2n + 1 terms of the Fourier sequence of two functions. By increasing n and recompiling the graph, one can see how the Fourier series approximates the original function.

### [02-18.ipynb](02-18.ipynb)

Used in 18 February's lecture. This file builds on 02-16.ipynb. The code is cleaned up a bit, and there are two more functions approximated by a Fourier sine series.
